# yt-dlp

A configurable command-line tool using [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) for deduplicating and tagging music.

Given a channel URL, yt-dlq will download the following as audio files, in order:

1. All videos in all playlists (albums) on the channel's _Releases_ tab
    - Each downloaded file will have its _Artist_ set as the uploader, its _Album_ set as the playlist title, and its _Album Artist_ set as the playlist's creator.
    - If a video is in multiple release playlists, it will be downloaded into all of them.
1. All videos in all playlists on the channels _Playlists_ tab
    - Each downloaded file will have its _Artist_ set as the uploader, its _Album_ set as the playlist title, and its _Album Artist_ set as the playlist's creator.
    - If a video is in multiple standard playlists, it will only be downloaded into the first one (unless `--playlist-duplicates` is passed on the CLI)
1. All other (public) videos uploaded by the channel.
    - A video will only be downloaded if it hasn't already been seen in a release or a standard playlist.
    - _Artist_ is the video's uploader, _Album_ is "Videos" (subject to change) and _Album Artist_ is the video's uploader.

Album art will also be embedded into each file.

Downloaded files will be organised into folders by album artist/channel, then album/playlist:
```
{Parent folder}
├{Channel}
│├{Release}
│├{Playlist}
│├{Playlist}
││├{Video}
││└{Video}
│└{Non-Playlist Video}
├{Channel}
```
